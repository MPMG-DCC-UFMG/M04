/* TWO_MODE_ELEMENT_CHOICE turns on the heuristic that decides in a different way the dimension the next enumerated element is taken in if the numbers of present elements still make it impossible to exceed any epsilon. The dimension is chosen so that there is the least number of enumeration nodes with barely enough present elements to exceed some epsilon. */
